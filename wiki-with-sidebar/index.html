                    <span>Plants</span> 
                    are the eukaryotes that form the kingdom 
                    <span>Plantae</span>;
                    they are predominantly photosynthetic. This means that they 
                    obtain their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts 
                    derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria to produce 
                    sugars from carbon dioxide and water, using the green 
                    pigment chlorophyll. Exceptions are parasitic plants that 
                    have lost the genes for chlorophyll and photosynthesis, and 
                    obtain their energy from other plants or fungi. 
                    Historically, as in Aristotle's biology, the plant kingdom 
                    encompassed all living things that were not animals, and 
                    included algae and fungi. Definitions have narrowed since 
                    then; current definitions exclude the fungi and some of the 
                    algae. By the definition used in this article, plants form 
                    the clade Viridiplantae(green plants), which consists of the 
                    green algae and the embryophytes or land plants (hornworts, 
                    liverworts, mosses, lycophytes, ferns, conifers and other 
                    gymnosperms, and flowering plants). A definition based on 
                    genomes includes the Viridiplantae, along with the red algae 
                    and the glaucophytes, in the clade Archaeplastida.

                    All living things were traditionally placed into one of two 
                    groups, plants and animals. This classification dates from 
                    Aristotle (384-322 BC), who distinguished different levels 
                    of beings in his biology, based on whether living things 
                    had a “sensitive soul” or like plants only a “vegetative 
                    soul”. Theophrastus, Aristotle's student, continued his 
                    work in plant taxonomy and classification. Much later, 
                    Linnaeus (1707-1778) created the basis of the modern system 
                    of scientific classification, but retained the animal and 
                    plant kingdoms, naming the plant kingdom the Vegetabilia.

                <p>
                    When the name Plantae or plant is applied to a specific 
                    group of organisms or taxa, it usually refers to one of four 
                    concepts.

                    There are about 382,000 accepted species of plants, of which 
                    the great majority, some 283,000, produce seeds. The table 
                    below shows some species count estimates of different green 
                    plant (Viridiplantae) divisions. About 85-90% of all plants 
                    are flowering plants. Several projects are currently 
                    attempting to collect records on all plant species in online 
                    databases, e.g. the World Flora Online. Plants range 
                    in scale from single-celled organisms such as desmids 
                    (from 10 micrometres across) and picozoa 
                    (less than 3 micrometres across), to the largest 
                    trees (megaflora) such as the conifer Sequoia sempervirens 
                    (up to 380 feet (120 m) tall ) and the angiosperm Eucalyptus 
                    regnans (up to 325 feet (99 m) tall ).

                <p>
                    The ancestors of land plants evolved in water. An algal scum 
                    formed on the land 1,200 million years ago, but it was not 
                    until the Ordovician, around 450 million years ago, that the 
                    first land plants appeared, with a level of organisation 
                    like that of bryophytes. However, evidence from 
                    carbon isotope ratios in Precambrian rocks suggests that 
                    complex plants developed over 1000 mya. Primitive land 
                    plants began to diversify in the late Silurian, around 420 
                    million years ago. Bryophytes, club mosses, and ferns then 
                    appear in the fossil record. Early plant anatomy is 
                    preserved in cellular detail in an early Devonian fossil 
                    assemblage from the Rhynie chert. These early plants were 
                    preserved by being petrified in chert formed in silica-rich 
                    volcanic hot springs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the end of the Devonian, most of the basic features of 
                    plants today were present, including roots, leaves and 
                    secondary wood in trees such as Archaeopteris. The 
                    Carboniferous Period saw the development of forests in 
                    swampy environments dominated by clubmosses and horsetails, 
                    including some as large as trees, and the appearance of 
                    early gymnosperms, the first seed plants. The 
                    Permo-Triassic extinction event radically changed the 
                    structures of communities. This may have set the scene 
                    for the evolution of flowering plants in the Triassic 
                    (~200 million years ago), with an adaptive radiation in the 
                    Cretaceous so rapid that Darwin called it an “abominable 
                    mystery“ Conifers diversified from the Late 
                    Triassic onwards, and became a dominant part of floras in 
                    the Jurassic.
