                    Melanie Martinez is an American singer/songwriter born in 
                    Astoria, Queens but was raised in Baldwin, New York. She 
                    first rose to fame after taking part on The Voice in 2012.

                    released her first debut single “Dollhouse” with 584 million 
                    streams to this date. She later released her very first 
                    album “Crybaby” in 2015 with now over 400 million plays on 
                    YouTube.

                <p>
                    Taking a break from music, she went to work on her next 
                    album along with a movie titled “K-12” which she released in 
                    2019. The movie shows how Crybaby (who is the character that 
                    Melanie plays throughout her career) and her friends fight

                    album and movie, Melanie releases an album called 
                    “Afterschool” in 2020 to express her feelings when dealing 
                    with relationships and her overall feelings on certain 
                    topics as the songs have deep messages.
