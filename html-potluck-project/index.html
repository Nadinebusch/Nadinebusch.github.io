        <h4>For the Raspberry Syrup</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a saucepan set over medium heat, cook the 1/4 cup 
                granulated sugar and 1 cup of raspberries, stirring 
                constantly, until they are broken down and syrupy. 
                About 10 min. It will still appear a little chunky and 
                that's fine.
            </li>

            <br>
            <br>
            <li>
                Set a mesh colander over a bowl. Pour the raspberry liquid 
                through the strainer and set aside to let cool. There should
                be about 2-3 tablespoons of raspberry syrup once it's 
                strained.
            </li>

        <h4>For the Cookies</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Measure out 1/2 cup frozen raspberries. Rough chop the 
                raspberries into small pieces. Be careful not to over chop; 
                you don't want raspberry pulp. 
                Place the chopped raspberries into a freezer safe bowl and 
                pop back into the freezer until you're ready to add them 
                into the dough.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten free flour, 
                baking powder, 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch and salt. Set 
                aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 2 heaping 
                tablespoons of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of 
                water until thin and watery.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle 
                attachment, beat the butter stick and 1 1/4 cups of the 
                sugar until it is soft and creamy.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Slowly beat the cornstarch water mixture, milk, the 
                cooled strained raspberry liquid (about 2-3 tablespoons) 
                into the creamed butter and sugar. It will look pink and 
                chunky.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Slowly beat in the gluten free flour mixture a little at a 
                time until just combined. If desired, add in 3-4 drops of 
                red food coloring and mix into the dough so it is blended 
                throughout.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Gently using a spatula, fold in the frozen chopped 
                raspberries. The dough will become a lovely marbled pink 
                color. Be careful not to mix too much or the dough will 
                become slimy.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Keep the dough in the bowl, cover the top with plastic wrap 
                and freeze for at least 1 hour. 
                <b>You must not</b> 
                skip this step or the cookies will spread everywhere and it 
                must be frozen, not in the fridge.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                After the dough has been in the freezer for at least 1 hour, 
                preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking 
                sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Use an ice cream scoop or a large cookie scoop to make large 
                cookies. It makes 12 scoops. Roll each dough ball in the 
                extra 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar to coat completely.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place dough balls about 3-4 inches apart on the parchment 
                lined baking sheet. Bake the cookies at 325 degrees 
                Fahrenheit for 15 minutes. Store extra dough balls in the 
                freezer while the rest are baking if they don't all fit. I 
                only bake 6 at a time. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Immediately reshape the cookies when they come out of the 
                oven by using a spatula to push them into a circle shape and 
                let cool on the baking sheet for 5 min before transferring 
                to a cooling rack. If you don't do this, the cookies will 
                break apart into a giant mess.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Storing</h4>
        <p>
            Keep extra cookies in an airtight container in the fridge for up
            to 3 days. 
        </p>

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <h4>For the Frosting</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small saucepan set over medium heat, combine the 
                quartered strawberries and granulated sugar. Stir 
                constantly for about 5-8 minutes until the strawberries 
                have liquified a bit and the sugar has dissolved. Use 
                the back of your spoon to mash the strawberries apart. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Set a strainer or a mesh colander over a bowl and strain 
                the strawberry liquid. You don't want any of the seeds, 
                you just want the liquid.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                With the paddle attachment of an electric mixer, or 
                using a large bowl and a hand mixer, beat the softened 
                vegan baking stick until creamy. About 2-3 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the confectioners sugar, water, strained strawberry 
                liquid (about 8 tablespoons), salt and vanilla. Beat 
                until smooth and combined.
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>
                If the strawberry liquid 
                solidified a bit, that's ok. Just use a spatula to 
                scrape it into your mixing bowl.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h4>For the Cake</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and grease 
                and line two 8 inch cake pans with parchment paper. Set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten free flour, cocoa 
                powders, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Measure out 1 cup of milk of choice in a large measuring cup and 
                add in 1 tablespoon of white vinegar. Mix with a spoon and let 
                sit for 5-10 minutes. This is your vegan buttermilk.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, using a spoon, mix together the cornstarch and 
                water until it is thin and watery. It will be thick and tacky at 
                first. Set aside. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, using a spoon, mix together the cornstarch and 
                water until it is thin and watery. It will be thick and tacky at 
                first. Set aside. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the cornstarch water mixture in two parts into the creamed 
                butter and sugar. Pour about half in and beat till combined then 
                pour in the second half and beat until combined.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Using a spoon, stir your vegan buttermilk. It will appear chunky 
                and this is what we want. In the same measuring cup, add in the 
                other 1/3 cup of milk, the teaspoon of white vinegar, the red 
                food coloring and the vanilla. Use a little whisk to combine 
                everything. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                With the mixer on low speed, add the dry and wet ingredients in 
                3 sections, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix 
                until fully combined. Use a spatula after to make sure it is 
                completely mixed.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                With a spatula, scoop half the batter into one cake pan and the 
                other half into the other pan. Smooth the tops with a butter 
                knife.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake the cakes in the center rack at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 
                45 minutes until slightly springy when carefully touched.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Let them cool in the pan and then transfer to a cooling rack.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once the cakes have completely cooled, slice the cakes in half 
                horizontally to create 4 thinner layers of cake. If the tops of 
                your cakes have domes, you can very carefully cut them off to 
                make them flat.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                While the cakes are baking, make the frosting.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Assembling the Cake</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Place one cake layer on the cake stand. Take 1/5 of the frosting 
                and frost the top. Place another layer of cake on top of the 
                frosting. Repeat the frosting layer. Repeat this process 3 
                times.
            </li>
            <br>

                width="300" 
                alt="layer strawberry red velvet cake."
            >
            <br>
            <li>
                Take the last layer of cake and put it bottom side up (or flat 
                side up) so the top is nice and flat.
                <br>
                <br>
                Use an icing spatula to frost the top and a thin layer on the 
                Usides. You should only use 1/5 of your frosting on the top and 
                sides. This is a semi naked cake.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Pop the entire cake uncovered in the fridge for 15-20 min so 
                it's more stable to work with.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Decorating the Cake</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                When the cake has only 5 min left in the fridge, make the 
                ganache.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place chocolate chips and butter or vegan baking sticks together 
                in a heat safe bowl. Microwave them together in 10-15 second 
                increments, stirring after each time, until the chocolate chips 
                and butter are fully melted and incorporated. This will take a 
                few min. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Immediately take the cake out of the fridge. Spoon almost all 
                the liquid ganache on top of the cake. Take an icing spatula and 
                push the ganache around to the edges of the cake so it drips 
                down the sides. Work quickly because the cold cake will quickly 
                stop the ganache from dripping too much. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Take the last 1/5th of buttercream and put it into a piping bag. 
                Create swirls going all the way around the top rim of the cake.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                If desired, place extra washed strawberries in the top center of 
                the cake. I used 5. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Storing</h4>

        <p>
            Once the cake is cut into, it's best to cut the entire cake into 
            slices, remove the strawberries and wrap each slice in foil and 
            store in a zip top bag in the fridge. Eat extra slices within 
            2 days.
            <br>
            <br>
            When ready to eat, let the slices sit on the counter, in the foil 
            for about an hour or until the cake is room temperature and soft. 
        </p>

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

        <h4>For the Cookies</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium microwave safe bowl, heat the frozen blueberries in 
                20 second increments, stirring after each time, until they are 
                soft, liquidy and jammy. This took me about 2-2.5 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Set aside to cool. They will thicken more as they cool.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten free flour, baking 
                powder, 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch and salt. Set aside. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, using a spoon, mix together the remaining 2 
                heaping tablespoons of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of water 
                until thin and watery. It will be thick and tacky at first.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle 
                attachment, beat the butter or vegan baking stick and 1 1/4 cups 
                of the sugar until it is soft and creamy. About 2-3 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Slowly beat the cornstarch water mixture, milk, the 
                cooled strained raspberry liquid (about 2-3 tablespoons) 
                into the creamed butter and sugar. It will look magenta and 
                chunky.
            </li>

            >
            <br>
            <li>
                Slowly beat in the gluten free flour mixture a little at a 
                time until just combined. If desired, add in 3-4 drops of 
                red food coloring and mix into the dough so it is blended 
                throughout.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Slowly beat in the gluten free flour mixture a little at a time 
                until just combined. The dough will be super sticky and 
                lavender. Keep the dough in the bowl, cover the top with plastic 
                wrap and refrigerate for at least 2.5 hours. 
                <br>
                <b>You must not skip this step</b> 
                or ,the cookies will spread everywhere. However, if you chill 
                the dough overnight but it will turn blue instead of lavender 
                with blue flecks. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                After 2.5 hours, preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. 
                Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Take the dough out of the fridge. Using an ice cream scoop, 
                scoop the dough out. You should have 12 scoops.Roll each dough 
                ball in the extra 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar to coat 
                completely.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Use an ice cream scoop or a large cookie scoop to make large 
                cookies. It makes 12 scoops. Roll each dough ball in the 
                extra 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar to coat completely.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place dough balls about 3-4 inches apart on the parchment lined 
                baking sheet. Bake the cookies at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 
                minutes. Store extra dough balls in the fridge while the rest 
                are baking if they don't all fit. I only bake 6 at a time. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Immediately reshape the cookies when they come out of the oven 
                by using a spatula to push them into a circle shape and let cool 
                on the baking sheet for 5 min before transferring to a cooling 
                rack. If you don't do this, the cookies will break apart into a 
                giant mess.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Storing</h4>
        <p>
            Keep extra cookies in an airtight container in the fridge for up
            to 3 days.
