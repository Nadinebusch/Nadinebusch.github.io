        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <h4>For the Raspberry Syrup</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a saucepan set over medium heat, cook the 1/4 cup 
                granulated sugar and 1 cup of raspberries, stirring 
                constantly, until they are broken down and syrupy. 
                About 10 min. It will still appear a little chunky and 
                that's fine.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Set a mesh colander over a bowl. Pour the raspberry liquid 
                through the strainer and set aside to let cool. There should
                be about 2-3 tablespoons of raspberry syrup once it's 
                strained.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>For the Cookies</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Measure out 1/2 cup frozen raspberries. Rough chop the 
                raspberries into small pieces. Be careful not to over chop; 
                you don't want raspberry pulp. 
                Place the chopped raspberries into a freezer safe bowl and 
                pop back into the freezer until you're ready to add them 
                into the dough.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten free flour, 
                baking powder, 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch and salt. Set 
                aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 2 heaping 
                tablespoons of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of 
                water until thin and watery.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle 
                attachment, beat the butter stick and 1 1/4 cups of the 
                sugar until it is soft and creamy.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Slowly beat the cornstarch water mixture, milk, the 
                cooled strained raspberry liquid (about 2-3 tablespoons) 
                into the creamed butter and sugar. It will look pink and 
                chunky.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Slowly beat in the gluten free flour mixture a little at a 
                time until just combined. If desired, add in 3-4 drops of 
                red food coloring and mix into the dough so it is blended 
                throughout.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Gently using a spatula, fold in the frozen chopped 
                raspberries. The dough will become a lovely marbled pink 
                color. Be careful not to mix too much or the dough will 
                become slimy.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Keep the dough in the bowl, cover the top with plastic wrap 
                and freeze for at least 1 hour. 
                <b>You must not</b> 
                skip this step or the cookies will spread everywhere and it 
                must be frozen, not in the fridge.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                After the dough has been in the freezer for at least 1 hour, 
                preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking 
                sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                 Use an ice cream scoop or a large cookie scoop to make large 
                cookies. It makes 12 scoops. Roll each dough ball in the 
                extra 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar to coat completely.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place dough balls about 3-4 inches apart on the parchment 
                lined baking sheet. Bake the cookies at 325 degrees 
                Fahrenheit for 15 minutes. Store extra dough balls in the 
                freezer while the rest are baking if they don't all fit. I 
                only bake 6 at a time. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Immediately reshape the cookies when they come out of the 
                oven by using a spatula to push them into a circle shape and 
                let cool on the baking sheet for 5 min before transferring 
                to a cooling rack. If you don't do this, the cookies will 
                break apart into a giant mess.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Storing</h4>
        <p>
            Keep extra cookies in an airtight container in the fridge for up
            to 3 days.

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <h4>For the Frosting</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small saucepan set over medium heat, combine the 
                quartered strawberries and granulated sugar. Stir 
                constantly for about 5-8 minutes until the strawberries 
                have liquified a bit and the sugar has dissolved. Use 
                the back of your spoon to mash the strawberries apart. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Set a strainer or a mesh colander over a bowl and strain 
                the strawberry liquid. You don't want any of the seeds, 
                you just want the liquid.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                With the paddle attachment of an electric mixer, or 
                using a large bowl and a hand mixer, beat the softened 
                vegan baking stick until creamy. About 2-3 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the confectioners sugar, water, strained strawberry 
                liquid (about 8 tablespoons), salt and vanilla. Beat 
                until smooth and combined.
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>
                If the strawberry liquid 
                solidified a bit, that's ok. Just use a spatula to 
                scrape it into your mixing bowl.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h4>For the Cake</h4>

            <li>
